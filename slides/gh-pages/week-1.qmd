# Housekeeping & Syllabus Review

## Purpose of discussion sections and STATA labs

&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- These discussions are integral to the course goals and curriculum
  - The lab component is particularly important as we work through projects

&nbsp;

- My goal is preparing you for the work force in public policy analysis
  - These jobs _expect_ you to have statistical reasoning _and_ analytical skills
  - Corporate environments with quant folks are focused on replicable, consistent analysis

&nbsp;

- Labs are shifting from application $\rightarrow$ workflow development
  - The class project ~~should~~ will look like work done at a think tank (Brookings, Urban, etc)
  - The projects are super valuable for quant jobs asking for writing & data samples

:::

## Attendance, expectations, and accessibility of course content


&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- Discussion section attendance is not optional and is expected (barring circumstances in the syllabus)
  - I want to help build your workforce-directed skills! Attend discussions please!

&nbsp;

- Week-to-week, discussions will follow a similar roadmap to today's session
  - Normally, no syllabus review. Just lecture review (1/3) and lab (2/3)
  - Later in semester, will allot some discussions **just** for projects

&nbsp;

- All course content will be accessible on Canvas <span style="color:#E64173">within 24 hours of class</span>
  - Includes my slides, lab solutions, videos of discussion (I will record one per Friday), and notes
  
:::




## Office hours, review sessions, and reaching your TAs

&nbsp;


::: {.incremental}

- Office hours (M/T/Tr) are meant to provide additional clarification on course content
  - My OH: <span style="background-color:#567293; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Tuesdays & Thursdays from 9:30a to 11a in MVR 3318</span> (next to Prof. Bottan's office)
    - I am happy to carve out time via Zoom for folks unable to make these times.
  - Prof. Bottan's OH: <span style="background-color:#567293; color:#FFFFFF; padding: 5px">Mondays from 9:30 to 11a in MVR 3220</span> (his office)

&nbsp;

- I host review sessions in lieu of office hours for all exams
  - Study guides are distributed via Canvas. Will answer Qs and clarifications.

&nbsp;

- I am <span style="background-color:#829356; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">reliably</span> available via email from <span style="background-color:#829356; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">9 to 5 on M thru F</span>
  - I answer all emails <span style="color:#E64173">within 48 hours</span>: if you haven't heard back, please bump it to the top of my inbox!!
  
:::




## Nitpicky things that will make my life easier if you do them (please)

&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- I use an email filter to put all class-related messages into a GMail folder
  - Please include <span style="background-color:#9a2515; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">[PAM 3100]</span> in the subject line
  - Without this, there is a chance it goes to spam! I don't want that!

&nbsp;

- Discussion and OH are meant to complement lecture, but discussion content is lab-focused
  - Towards the end of semester, I cannot cover discussion materials in OH and

&nbsp;

- Please do not call me <span style="background-color:#E64173; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Mr.</span> or <span style="background-color:#E64173; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Prof.</span> - <span style="background-color:#829356; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Shyam</span> is perfectly fine
  - My knees make me feel old after walking up stairs. I don't need this too.

:::




## Your mental health and wellbeing should always come before this class

&nbsp;


::: {.incremental}

- Your brain is a muscle. It needs food, water, and rest.
  - You don't have to ask me to leave the room for water or restroom because <span style="background-color:#829356; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">you're adults</span>


&nbsp;

- Your body needs sun! Seasonal affective disorder (aptly, SAD) is particularly real in Ithaca
  - Our bodies are programmed to rest when it's dark outside (like 5pm)
  - <span style="background-color:#567293; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">You deserve rest.</span> If coming to discussion is precluding this, please tell me.

&nbsp;

- If you are struggling with your mental health or wellbeing, please reach out if you're comfortable.
  - While extensions/late assignment policy is firm, content can be made more accessible

:::


## Three things that will maximize the benefit of this class for everyone

&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- Every question is worth asking. Most questions could be asked better.
  - <span style="background-color:#E64173; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">“I’m confused on variables, can we go over it again?”</span>
  - <span style="background-color:#829356; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">"I'm confused. Can you go over the difference between a discrete and ordinal variable?"</span>
  
&nbsp;

- Things only get better with feedback. If something isn't working for you, please tell me.
  - Most often, others will benefit from things that help you. We learn in similar ways!
  - I will have small feedback surveys used as attendance points throughout the semester

&nbsp;

- If you can't make it to discussion, please send me an email!
  - I teach all 4 sections and will always offer attending at a different time
  - If you want to avoid this offer, tell me in the email that you are out for the day.

# Review of This Week's Lectures


## What ~~is~~ are data?

&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- Data are a collection of information -- data points -- that can be be communicated

&nbsp;

- Datasets come in a rectangular form (columns and rows). We call this "tidy data".
- Tidy data is constructed of <span style="color:#695693">variables</span>, <span style="color:#9a2515">observations</span>, and <span style="color:#829356">values</span> such that:

  - Each <span style="color:#695693">variable</span> has its own  <span style="color:#695693">column</span>
  - Each <span style="color:#9a2515">observation</span> has its own <span style="color:#9a2515">row</span>
  - Each <span style="color:#9a2515">observation</span> has a <span style="color:#829356">value</span> -- or "data point" -- for each <span style="color:#695693">variable</span>


:::

## What are <span style="background-color:#695693; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">variables</span>? What types of <span style="background-color:#695693; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">variables</span> do we use in statistics?

&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- Factor (categorical) variables reflect data as belonging to one or more groups
  - Ordinal variables are distinct, reflecting ordered groups

&nbsp;

- Numerical variables contain information recorded and interpreted as numbers
  - Discrete -- or count -- variables are integer values $\in 0, 1, \cdots, k$ 
  - Continuous variables have infinite possible values (integer, decimal, negative)

&nbsp;

- We will focus heavily on continuous variables, their distributions, and characteristics

:::

## A continuous variable forms a <span style="background-color:#F26D21; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">distribution</span> of values in a series of data


```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


normalDat%>% 
  
    ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
    ggdist::geom_dots(color = NA, fill = "#567293") +
    xlab("Values of Continuous Variable X") +
    ylab("Distribution Frequency") +
    labs(color = NULL) +
    scale_color_nejm() +
    theme_shyam(base_size = 20) + theme(legend.position = 'none')


```




## How do we measure the center of a data?

```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist


```


## How do we measure the center of a data? <span style="background-color:#9a2515; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Median</span>

```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = median(value)), color = "#9a2515", size = 3)


```

## How do we measure the center of a data? <span style="background-color:#107895; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Mean ($\mu$)</span>

```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist + geom_vline(aes(xintercept = mean(value)), color = "#107895", size = 3)


```

## How do we measure the spread of data?

```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist


```



## How do we measure the spread of data? <span style="background-color:#EBC944; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Range</span>

```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist + geom_segment(aes(x = min(value), xend = max(value), y = 0.5, yend = 0.5), color = "#EBC944", size = 3) 


```



## How do we measure the spread of data? <span style="background-color:#F26D21; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Variance</span>

&nbsp;


::: {.incremental}

- Variance is the average, squared difference between each data point and the variable's mean.
  - What does this tell us?
  
&nbsp;

- A variable whose distribution has a high variance has many data points far away from the mean
- A variable whose distribution has a low variance means most data points are clustered around the mean

&nbsp;

- The square root of the variance is the <span style="background-color:#F26D21; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">standard deviation ($\sigma$)</span> 

:::



## How do we measure the spread of data? <span style="background-color:#F26D21; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Standard deviation (SD)</span> 


```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist +
   geom_segment(aes(x = mean(value), xend = mean(value) + sd(value), y = 0.75, yend = 0.75), color = "#F26D21", size = 3) 


```





## How do we measure the spread of data? <span style="background-color:#314F4F; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">2 SDs from the mean</span>


```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


dist +
   geom_segment(aes(x = mean(value), xend = mean(value) + sd(value), y = 0.75, yend = 0.75), color = "#F26D21", size =3)+
   geom_segment(aes(x = mean(value), xend = mean(value) + sd(value)*2, y = 0.5, yend = 0.5), color = "#314F4F", size = 3) 


```


## What kind of distributions do <span style="background-color:#107895; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">random variables</span> take?

&nbsp;

::: {.incremental}

- First: what is a <span style="background-color:#107895; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">random variable</span>?
  - Always a **numeric** quantity whose value depends on the outcome of a <span style="color:#107895">random</span> event
  - A random variable <span style="background-color:#107895; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">X</span> has the values <span style="background-color:#107895; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">x</span> such that its distribution can provide us the Pr(X = x)

&nbsp;

- Discrete random variables
  - Are comprised of integer values or counts of something (same as discrete variables)
  - Have values that form a probability distribution

&nbsp;

- Continuous random variables
  - Are comprised of real (decimal) values which are not bounded like counts
  - Have values that form a probability density function (PDF)


:::


## Consider a <span style="background-color:#107895; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">random variable</span> Z ~ N(0,1): this is the <span style="background-color:#EBC944; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">Standard normal distribution</span>


```{r}
#| fig.width = 15, fig.height = 8, fig.align = 'center',
#| message = F, warning = F, eval = T, include = T, echo = F


data.frame(id = 1:1000,
            value = rnorm(1000, mean = 0, sd = 1)) %>% 
  
    ggplot(aes(x = value)) +
    ggdist::geom_dots(color = NA, fill = "#EBC944") +
    xlab("Values of Random Variable Z ~ N(0,1)") +
    ylab("Distribution Frequency") +
    labs(color = NULL) +
    scale_color_nejm() +
    theme_shyam(base_size = 20) + theme(legend.position = 'none')


```


## Using these measures, we can leverage the probability distribution of data

&nbsp;


::: {.incremental}

- Often, we'd like to know the probability of drawing a certain value from data distribution. How?
  - Assuming a <span style="background-color:#EBC944; color:#FFFFFF; padding:5px">standard normal distribution</span>, we can use STATA!
  - To find the $Pr(Z<c)$, run the command `display normal(c)`. This produces a lower tail probability

&nbsp;

- Other times, we want to know the cut-off value $c$ that gives a probability $p$
  - Here, we can still use STATA but leverage the "inverse normal" functionality
  - To find the critical value at which $Pr(Z<c)$, run the command `display invnormal(p)`
